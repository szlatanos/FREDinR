# FREDinR
This is a collection of scripts to find and get data from FRED in R, using the [fredr](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/fredr/versions/2.1.0) package

## Find series of interest
For this purpose you can use [findFREDdata.R](https://github.com/szlatanos/FREDinR/blob/main/findFREDdata.R). In this example we use the search by text function, but other ways are also possible (e.g. via tags).

## Get series of interest
For this purpose you can use [getFREDdata.R](https://github.com/szlatanos/FREDinR/blob/main/getFREDdata.R).
